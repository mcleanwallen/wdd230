        <h3>Aurora History</h3>
        <p>
        Aurora was incorporated as the town of Fletcher on April 30, 1891. 
        The new town, one of many suburbs sprouting up around Denver, was 
        four square miles of prairie reaching from Yosemite Street east to 
        Peoria Street and 6th Avenue north to 26th Avenue. Named after one 
        of the developers, Donald Fletcher, the town boasted 39 citizens, 
        the beginnings of a water system and 14 new brick homes designed 
        with indoor plumbing.
        </p>
        <p>
        The high hopes of the new residents and the developers were short lived. 
        A drought soon put an end to the water system and the Silver Panic of 
        1893 caused a severe drop in property values. Nonetheless, the town of 
        Fletcher persisted and in 1907 the town was renamed Aurora. In 1928, 
        after reaching a population of more than 2,000 citizens, the Colorado 
        Secretary of State recognized Aurora as a city. The city seal has five 
        stars on it, a feature kept from the original city emblem made to adorn a 
        previous Municipal Building in the 1950s. The five stars represent home, 
        church, school, business and industry, all essential to a healthy, 
        progressive community, according to a guidebook published during the 
        administration of Mayor Paul C. Beck (1967-74).
        </p>
        <p>
        Growth boomed during the post-war years due primarily to the three 
        military bases: Lowry Air Force Base, Fitzsimons Army Hospital, and Buckley 
        Air Base. Since the 1970s Aurora has doubled in size and now occupies 160 
        square miles and has more than 386,000 residents. Aurora history is one 
        of change, growth, diversity, and community.

        <h3>Aurora's Military Heritage</h3>
        
        <p>
        Since the very early years of this city, the military has been a big part 
        of Aurora's history. For almost 100 years, Aurora has been home to 
        countless service men and women and their families. They are part of a 
        rich heritage that makes up our community. Let's take time to honor those 
        who have served and are serving our country in the armed forces.
        </p>
        <p>
        In 1918 during the beginning of Auroraâ€™s first building boom, Army General 
        Hospital #21 (re-named Fitzsimons Army Hospital) was built east of town. 
        Twenty years later, in 1938, Lowry Air Force Base was opened to the southwest 
        of town. Rather than closing Fitzsimons, the U.S. government expanded and 
        upgraded the hospital facilities in 1941 just in time to care for the wounded 
        servicemen of World War II. Lowry expanded to a site 15 miles to the east in 
        1942 that eventually became Buckley Air National Guard Base and later 
        Buckley Air Force Base.

        Aurora is now home to the Colorado Freedom Memorial, dedicated in 2013 to honor 
        all of those Colorado military personnel who have lost their lives in combat 
        while serving our country.
